# Call center

- Using tkinter as graphical library
- Using redis as db
## You can :
- Create a call (by filling out the form)
- Check others calls (those who are not already affected) and get more datas by choosing one in the combobox.
- Affect a call to someone by choosing the operator. You need to select one operator and one call.
- Print all calls by operator.
